- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Justin Marciano, the CEO and Cofounder of IdentifAI

- IdentifAI is a novel approach to address the challenge of deepfake proliferation on the internet. Our product proactively protects media 
against generative AI manipulation and leverages accurate image authentication over existing detection methods that rely on the strength 
of the deepfake detection model. Utilizing our proprietary contour algorithms, patent-pending anti-deepfake technology, and machine learning 
techniques, our platform offers a streamlined service for protecting, managing, and monitoring image integrity in real time for enterprises 
at high risk of deepfake attacks.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in deepfakes, blockchain technology, and macroeconomics. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything deepfake security-related!
